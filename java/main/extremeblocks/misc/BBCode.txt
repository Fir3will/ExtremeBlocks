When a fire is set next to it, it will blow up, with the same strength of a TNT

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Recipe Reverting Station:[/color][/b]
Upon right-clicking this block. It'll display a small Gui that's pretty much a flipped Crafting table. But the difference is that you put your item in the big slot and it'll show the recipe on the side.
Then you could take the exact things you used to get everything back! It works with all kinds of recipes! Even other mods recipes! So if you find something that you don't want in a dungeon, go ahead and put it in the table and salvage some of the stuff back!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Altar:[/color][/b]
When placed in a four block tall column, it, explosively, spawns the Demon Spirit! This can also be crafted!

Very useless at the moment...

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Fuse:[/color][/b]
You could place this on a block and light it, this will burn and burn the fuses next to it too. You could train this to a Powder keg to blow it up

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Grenade:[/color][/b]
When right clicked, you will throw a grenade out and it will blow up where it lands

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Molotov:[/color][/b]
Similar to a Grenade but doesn't blow up anything, just set's fire everywhere

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Mellow/Weed/Hemp Leaves:[/color][/b]
Isn't working properly, so won't be functional, even if explained...

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Pestle and Mortar:[/color][/b]
When right clicked with some Weed or Hemp leaves in the inventory, has a chance to turn those into a more powerful version

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Orange/Banana/Peach/Grapes:[/color][/b]
Can be eaten to heal some hunger

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Robot:[/color][/b]
When used on a block, spawns a Robot in that position corresponding to the Robot. Note that the Complete Robot needs to be crafted with some tool to be used

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Furnace Upgrade:[/color][/b]
When placed in the Cooker's Arrow slot, it will work twice as fast and consume the item. Then when placed in the slot again, it will work even faster. SO on and so forth, all the way till it's uprades are to ten!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Battery:[/color][/b]
This is a portable way to carry around the power that you want to have with you. Kinda like a portable generator. Most of the machines let you use this but one doesn't. The Arrow Tower. That needs RAW POWER!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Tomato/Seeds:[/color][/b]
Another food and crop. The Tomato's saturaturation isn't bad. It's the same as an apple, but you do get quite some from the crop. The seeds are obtained like normal wheat seeds. Punching grass!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Cucumber/Seeds:[/color][/b]
Similar to the Tomato's saturation, the Cucumber's saturaturation is the same as an apple. The seeds are also obtained like normal wheat seeds!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Sorters:[/color][/b]
The sorters are exactly what they say they are! They sort the inventory corresponding to their names. I think most of them are pretty self explanatory, but these ones: 
- Rarity Sorter: This sort's it by the color of it's name. Like the Golden Apples and some enchanted tools, If it's value is higher, it's higher in the inventory!
- Items Sorter: Sorts by half the inventory in Items, then the bottom half in blocks. Simple!
- Durability Sorter: If the item is a tool, and it's durability is higher, it'll be higher up in the chest!
- Tools Sorter (WIP): When used, it will sort the better tools ontop of the chest. Not by durability or kind. If it has a higher harvest level, it'll be higher in the chest!
Most sorter's are crafted the same way, except the two items ontop on the side, the recipes are posted in the album. Make sure to check it out!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Spirit Fragment:[/color][/b]
Dropped by the Demon Spirit, can be used in very overpowered weapons! But you need two for the sword!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Super Tools:[/color][/b]
The Super tools are very powerful tools that actually can be crafted! Using Bedrock! 
Doing a million damage, using the shovel will do tons of damage! Also cinsidering, they're extremely efficient!

NOTE: Every other Item is just used in crafting or isn't very useful right now.

[spoiler]
[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Evil Iron Golem:[/color][/b]
The Evil Iron Golem is similar to the Iron Golem but it's texture is red and it attacks everything! Even it's own kind!
It could also be built! The same way that the Iron Golem is but not with Iron Blocks! With the mods Trinquantium Blocks!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Castle Zombie:[/color][/b]
This mob spawn in and protects the Castles. These have weapons with a lot of knockback to keep you away from their loot.

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Castle Skeleton:[/color][/b]
Similar to the Zombie type, this mob spawn in and protects the Castles. These have bows with a lot of knockback and spawn in front of the castle to keep you from getting in.

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Demon Spirit:[/color][/b]
This mob is a Boss! WHOA! This thing will get you really mad! Go ahead, give yourself the most overpowered items, it'll still be difficult! The special attacks of this mad are:
* Web Spit: The web shot is when he throws two webs right at you, and you get stuck!
* Wither Shot: Shoots a Wither Skull at you
* Foe Flinging: It throws you about 4 block up in the air!
* The Bully: The Powers of the spirit command al the items in your inventory to drop to the ground!
* Summoner: If it's health is less than 50%, it'll spawn many Pig Zombies that by default are mad at you!
* Volley Attack: Shoots out 5 arrows right at the attacker! Speak of power!
Ontop of all that, they look absolutely hellish!
They also have some protection!
* They can't get stuck in webs
* They're fireproof
* Also, if placed in water, it get's rid of it!
Upon death, they drop the Spirit Fragment. And TONS of Rotten Flesh!

[color=rgb(0, 0, 255)][b]Robot:[/color][/b]
This mob can be used to complete multiple different tasks. These tasks include: Farming, Mining, Hunting, and Guarding If spawned with an Egg, it receives a random profession. 
* If you place some food in the Robot's inventory, when the Robot's health is low, it will consume that food and the hunger it gives, will be added to the Robot's health!
* Adding armor to the Robot will increase it's defence against attacks. Very useful for the fighting robots!
* Killing the Entity will simply remove it giving back nothing.
* If you kill the robot with a sword that has atleast 1 looting, you will get everything, used to craft it, back.

[b]Professions and Actions:[/b]
- Farmer
    The farmer will break vanilla crops and place seeds there. If you give them a hoe! Remember that the Items get used. It checks a 30x30x30 radius to see if there are any crops around, If there are, it will proceed to them. If successfull in it's travel, it will break the crops and plant seeds there, if it has! It even farms Carrots and also Potatoes!
- Warrior
    The Warrior will kill any hostile mobs in it's range. It will walk up to the mobs and kill them. Also collect the loot!
- Archer
    The Archer, similar to the warrior, uses the bow and shoots the mobs with arrows.
- Hunter
    The Hunter walks around and kills and animals it sees, including cows, pigs, horses, chickens, etc. It also collects the loot. If the animal is far, it will use the bow. If it is close (int 3 blocks radius) it will take out it's sword for combat!
- Miner
    The Miner will mine all the way to bedrock and then nerd-pole out of the 1x2 hole it creates and start wandering around!
