[color=red]I HIGHLY recommend watching therealtkh's mod spotlight, it is very informative and has everything you need to know![/color]
[color=red]I also recommend you just use the ingame Extreme Blocks guide. It has all the information and I think it's a bit more manageable. All the information in the guide is also here. Exact same definitions![/color]
[color=red]P.S. It's alphabetized![/color]

World Generation Info:
[spoiler]
[color=blue][b]Cannabis Plant:[/color][/b]
This spawns just like Sugarcane.

[color=blue][b]Castle:[/color][/b]
The castle spawns in a very large plains area. It needs more than 9 spaces in width. 11 spaces in length and 9 spaces in height to spawn. Then if there is all that space, it's a 1% chance to spawn! So I'd search in the Extreme Hills! Right!?!?

[color=blue][b]Catacombs:[/color][/b]
The catacombs need less space to spawn but it's a lot more rare. It needs a 5x5x5 area full of stone. That's a hint that it will spawn in the ground! If there's a 5x5x5 are full of stone, there's then a 0.3% chance that it will generate there! Also, it will always be found half way between bedrock and the surface.

[color=blue][b]Dried Tree:[/color][/b]
The Dried Tree spawns in very hot biomes. This is most abundant int the vanilla desert. It's one large column of Dried Tree Logs.

The house is an amazing place to get some brick blocks. It's a very nice simple starter house. This needs a 4x5x4 open space to spawn. It's a great starting position!

[color=blue][b]Sunken Ship:[/color][/b]
The sunken ship spawn only in extremely large and deep bodies of water. To be specific, it needs, 24x14x5 area just filled in with water. Then from that, there's a 1/40 percent chance to spawn there as well!

I didn't give more information about the structures itself because I want you guys to go and explore them and feel free to drop a comment about what you found!
