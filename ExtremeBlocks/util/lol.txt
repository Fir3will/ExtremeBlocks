[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/109/baa7.png[/img]
This Is such a Great tool for Survival, even though it is quite expensive! When crafted, it could be used to complete the X-Ray block recipe!

This is how you convert the Weak Cement Wall into a Place-able Cement Wall!

[spoiler][img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/22/d6gm.png[/img]
These are the OVERWORLD Ores that randomly generate throughout your Minecraft World!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/543/lki8.png[/img]
This Is the Tin and Copper Ore and also their drops from breaking the block!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/853/u1xd.png[/img]
These are the Delvlish and Glester Ores! These are used to complete the XRay Block and will hopefully have a bigger use later on in future updates!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/690/tc6r.png[/img]
I am now going to show you the LightStone. Here there is nothing but a redstone torch up above in the slot. There are more like this for example bricks and planks! Now were going to see the Lighstone's capabilities!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/191/9wfy.png[/img]
There's just one LIGHTSTONE! You Craft this by putting the stone all around a torch in the crafting table!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/844/wu3r.png[/img]
Wow, Just wOw! Look at that! This is honestly a miracle! Sadly redstone can't handle the power of the darker forces of the Nether so it couldn't have been generated in the Nether! (This is just a story, I forgot to add Redstone Ore to the Nether, Will be there in the next updates, Hopefully!)
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/849/jiqn.png[/img]
WOW, You can see Everything Behind that Block! As you can see, in the distance, there is water in that little revene! It's amazing! If you don't believe me and caught me, go download the mod for yourself and check it out!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/849/cix1.png[/img]

This is the Updated version of the Cellphone! As you can see, it is much more useful!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/809/cm6g.png[/img]
This is the Comparison of the two new PS3 and the Xbox 360 Consoles! Also accompanied by Controllers!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/10/gvfp.png[/img]
The textures are a bit strange but that was just the general look I wanted!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/580/xu3g.png[/img]
These are the new tool sets! Delvlish and Glester! In comparison, they are EXTREMELY different! Delvlish sucks at harvesting blocks but Glester sucks at attacking!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/33/i73h.png[/img]
This is the Dried Sapling! Looks a lot like the dead bush but is quite different!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/11/n917.png[/img]

[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/703/8ofi.png[/img]
A bucket of water! It really works like an Infinite water Source!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/689/fm5q.png[/img]
You Can also see, when clicked with a wrench, spawn a block of water on top!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/826/txe5.png[/img]
This is the new Ore and what it does!, It's called Limestone!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/211/gnf2.png[/img]
By Mining Limestone Rock, you get a Limestone!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/546/fwv0.png[/img]
This is the different elements of the Consoles! Xbox 360 needs Light and the PS3 needs a Core Chip!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/826/p8qe.png[/img]
This is the Lantern! Very Useful for survival and the Crafting recipe is extremely easy!
[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/31/jiql.png[/img]

[img]http://imageshack.com/scaled/800x600/35/dh3k.png[/img]
This is Nuclear Waste! If you step on it, or any other mob steps on it, it sets them on Fire! Also you walk very slow in it! You could even harvest it!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img32/1466/x45s.png[/img]
This is the Vending Machine! When clicked with a Gold Coin, you get a random Item back! Try it out!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img203/7223/90jd.png[/img]
This is Called the Aesthetic Block! It drops like sand! Straight down!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img593/6250/g5hm.png[/img]
This is it Dropping in Action! Note: There is no Recipe for this Block. it spawns naturally!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img10/6609/cnpu.png[/img]
This is the Drill! Put this baby down onto the floor and it'll drill a hole straight down to bedrock, or air!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img593/3070/3fft.png[/img]
This is the Drill in action!
[img]http://imageshack.com/a/img707/7231/co27.png[/img]
You can even right click it to get all the stone you broke with this block!
